*what?*

a toy app idea I had on the way home. sketched out the plan on the bus, first commit when I reached home - visualising JSON data in a more friendly way.

*why?*

Well, even though JSON is by itself readable, I once had to work with some complex returns and honestly, I like juicy graphics better.

*how?*

Check examples for a small example for now.

*screen shots?*

*notes*

It's still crude. But more fixes and fleshing out on this idea when I can get the time!
