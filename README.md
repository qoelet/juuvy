# juuvy #

*what?*

a toy app idea I had on the way home. sketched out the plan on the bus, first commit when I reached home - visualising JSON data in a more friendly way.

*why?*

Well, even though JSON is by itself readable, I once had to work with some complex returns and honestly, I like juicy graphics better.

*how?*

You will need at the least jQuery and Raphaeljs included in your HTML file. I use LABjs to ensure proper loading of dependencies. Then load in your local/remote JSON data using jQuery.getJSON and pass it to Juuvy. See the small example included.

*note*

This is in heavvvy development - which really means after spending 4 hours getting this from paper to code, it's full of noobish bugs and not much features. I only tested it with flat JSON structures, so nested arrays won't work. (yet)

The randomizer is primitive, so refresh a few times for better results probably.
