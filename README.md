*what?*

a toy app idea I had on the way home. sketched out the plan on the bus, first commit when I reached home - visualising JSON data in a more friendly way.

*why?*

Well, even though JSON is by itself readable, I once had to work with some complex returns and honestly, I like juicy graphics better.
